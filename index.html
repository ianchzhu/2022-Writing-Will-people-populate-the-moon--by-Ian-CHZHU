               <p>Elon Musk is a person that loves technology and space. He did the car named tesla also, he is a fan of Nikola Tesla, so he named his car 'tesla' to do he's dream:Occupy Mars ,so he made a personal company:spacex.</p>
               <p>e said: “You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great - and that’s what being a spacefaring civilization is all about. It’s about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. And I can’t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars.”</p>
